A REST API is a standardized way to provide data to other applications.

There are a few key options for a REST API request:
GET — The most common option, returns some data from the API based on the endpoint you visit and any parameters you provide
POST — Creates a new record that gets appended to the database
PUT — Looks for a record at the given URI you provide. If it exists, update the existing record. If not, create a new record
DELETE — Deletes the record at the given URI
PATCH — Update individual fields of a record

Serialize the Hero model
Now we’re starting to get into some new waters. 
We need to tell REST Framework about our Hero model and how it should serialize the data.
Remember, serialization is the process of converting a Model to JSON. Using a serializer, 
we can specify what fields should be present in the JSON representation of the model.
